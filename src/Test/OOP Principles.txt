In Object Oriented Programming, there are four principles.
They are as follows:
1) Abstraction
2) Polymorphism
3) Inheritance
4) Encapsulation

1) Abstraction: Abstraction means hiding the internal details and showing the functionality to the user.

2) Polymorphism: Polymorphism means ability to take many forms. In Java, polymorphism can be achieved by two methods namely
                 method overloading and method overriding.
                 Method Overloading: Used within a class
                 Method Overriding: Used outside the class which has inherited the parent class.

3) Inheritance: Inheritance is the ability to inherit all the properties of a class to the another class.
                The class being inherited is known as parent class or super class or derived class.
                The class who is inheriting the properties is called as child class or sub class or base class.

4) Encapsulation: Encapsulation can be defined as wrapping up of data. It is used for data hiding.
                  Advantage -> We can create a read only or write only class using Encapsulation.

5)
