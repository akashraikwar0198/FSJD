1. public - Public is accessible through out the project
      2. private - private is accessible only within class
      3. protected - protected is accessible only within a package,
                     but accessible in another package through inheritance
      4. default - it is accessible only within a package. and it is more restrictive than protected.


Polymorphism -
            It is ability to take many forms.
            ex-
            1 . Method overloading - if same method name have multiple time is same class it is called method overloading.
                                     It increases program readability.
            rule for method overloading - 1. same name but different number of parameters
                                          2. same number of parameter but different datatype.

            2. Method Overriding - If child class have same method name in that parent class then is called method overriding.

abstraction ->
1) interface ->
 *if interface have 1 abstract method this called functional interface;
 *if interface have multiple methods then it is called normal interface
 *if interface have no method then it is called marker interface.


Throwable ->
1. Exception ->
             1. IOException
             2. SQLException
             3. FileNotFoundException
             4. RunTimeException ->
                                   - ArithmeticException
                                   - NullPointerException
                                   - NumberFormatException
                                   - IndexOutOfBoundException -
                                                              ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
                                                              StringIndexOutOfBoundException


2. Error ->
        1. StackOverFlowError
        2. OutOfMemoryError
        3. AssertionError


 **There are two types Exceptions

        1 .checked Exception - they are come at compile time and compiler will force you to handle these exception.
        2. unchecked Exception - all runtime exception are unchecked exception.
